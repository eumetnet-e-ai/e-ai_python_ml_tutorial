\chapter{Fine-Tuning LLMs}

\section{Introduction to Finetuning Large Language Models}
Finetuning allows pretrained LLMs to adapt to specific tasks, domains, or datasets, improving their performance without training from scratch.

\section{Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing}
Successful finetuning starts with well-curated datasets, requiring careful selection, cleaning, tokenization, and formatting to ensure high-quality inputs.

\section{Techniques and Strategies for Finetuning}
Various approaches, including full-model finetuning, parameter-efficient tuning like LoRA, and reinforcement learning, enable different levels of adaptation and efficiency.

\section{Evaluation and Deployment of Finetuned Models}
After finetuning, models must be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics, monitored for bias, and optimized for scalable deployment.
