\chapter{AnemoI â€“ AI-Based Weather Modeling}

\section{Introduction to AnemoI}
AnemoI is an AI-driven weather modeling system designed to enhance numerical weather prediction (NWP) through deep learning techniques. This section provides an overview of its role, capabilities, and applications in meteorology.

\section{Core Architecture and AI Components}
AnemoI leverages a combination of neural networks and physics-informed machine learning to model atmospheric processes. The system integrates with conventional forecasting models to improve accuracy and computational efficiency.

\section{Training AnemoI with Historical Weather Data}
To develop robust AI models, AnemoI is trained on large-scale reanalysis datasets, satellite observations, and in-situ measurements. This section outlines the preprocessing, feature selection, and data augmentation techniques used for training.
