\chapter{Model Emulation and AICON}

\section{The AICON Training Dataset}
The AICON framework relies on a curated dataset derived from high-resolution NWP simulations, observational data, and reanalysis products. The dataset is processed to ensure consistency, quality control, and suitability for deep learning applications.

\section{The AICON Setup, Grid and Graph Network}
AICON is built on a structured computational grid that aligns with existing numerical models. The AI network architecture includes convolutional layers, recurrent structures, and transformer-based models for capturing spatiotemporal dependencies.

\section{How AICON Hierarchical Training works}
AICON employs a hierarchical training strategy, where models are initially trained on coarse-resolution data and progressively refined with finer-scale features. This approach enhances generalization while maintaining computational efficiency.

\section{AICON Runs Verification}
Operational AICON runs involve inference on real-time meteorological data. This section describes the execution pipeline, computational requirements, and evaluation metrics used to validate model performance.
