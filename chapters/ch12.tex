\section{The LLM AI Interface and Framework DAWID}

We show the design and setup of the LLM AI interface and framework DAWID, integrating AI/ML based services, specific knowledge, functions and data with an LLM based chatbot interface. 

\section{AI-Assisted Feature Detection in Weather and Climate Data}

LLMs, combined with vision models, can detect and classify meteorological structures such as cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and thunderstorms from satellite and radar imagery. These models can help automate severe weather monitoring and early warning systems.

\section{Automated Weather Report Generation and Interpretation}

By fine-tuning LLMs on numerical weather model outputs and past forecasts, AI can generate structured weather reports, translate forecast uncertainties into human-readable summaries, and assist in rapid decision-making for operational meteorologists.

\section{Communicating Weather and Climate Information with LLMs}

LLMs can enhance communication by translating complex meteorological data into accessible narratives for different audiences, from scientific experts to the general public, ensuring clarity and preventing misinterpretations.

\section{Impact-Based Decision Support Tools for Weather and Climate}

Integrating LLMs with impact-based forecasting systems allows users to assess how weather and climate events will affect specific sectors (e.g., transportation, agriculture, energy). AI-driven tools can provide tailored recommendations and risk assessments.
