\chapter{MLOps - Operations}

\section{Introduction to MLOps: Principles and Workflow}
This section provides an overview of MLOps, outlining its core principles, the lifecycle of machine learning models in production, and how it bridges the gap between data science and operations.

\section{Model Deployment and Monitoring}
We explore different deployment strategies (batch, real-time, edge AI) and discuss monitoring techniques, including drift detection, model performance tracking, and automated retraining pipelines.

\section{CI/CD for Machine Learning: Automation and Reproducibility}
This section covers how continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices are adapted for ML workflows, ensuring automated testing, versioning, and reproducibility.

\section{Scalability and Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Cloud, and On-Premise Solutions}
We examine infrastructure choices for MLOps, comparing cloud-based solutions, Kubernetes orchestration, and on-premise setups, emphasizing cost-efficiency and scalability.
